I'm a student at UW-Whitewater and I will be graduating in Spring 2027 with a triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Japanese Studies. As I approach my graduation, I will be completing more projects that will be compiled and shown below. Here are a few that I am proud of.

## Project Portfolio

* The [Maze Generator Game](../Final-Maze-2022/) was the final project for Intermediate C++.
* My [Heroes Leaper](../PvZHeroes-Leaper) was a tool to assist with the game 'Plants Vs. Zombies Heroes' and was created in my JavaScript and DHTML class.
* The [Board Game Analysis](../Stats2025-Board-Game-Analysis/) project was made for my Applied Statistics class and analyzes various metrics over 19,000 board games.
